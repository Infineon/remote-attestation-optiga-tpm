# tpm-remote-attestation

## Introduction
Remote attestation is a mechanism to enable a remote system (server) to determine the health/integrity of a platform of another system. In a Linux-based system, a security feature known as the Integrity Measurement Architecture (IMA) can be used to capture platform measurements. Together with Infineon OPTIGAâ„¢ TPM (Trusted Platform Module), a hardware-based security and its set of attestation features, it can be used to perform authentication and to protect IMA measurements; consequently, raises the trust level of remote attestation.

In this repository, you will find attestation server and device (Raspberry Pi 3/4) reference implementations.
