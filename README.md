# Introduction

Remote attestation is a mechanism to enable a remote system (server) to determine the integrity of a platform of another system (Raspberry PiÂ®). In a Linux-based system, a security feature known as the Integrity Measurement Architecture (IMA) can be used to capture platform measurements. Together with TPM a hardware-based security and its set of attestation features, it can be used to perform authentication and to protect the IMA measurement.
